# COORDINATION.md — Koreatrip1 (merged — both sessions preserved)

## Session claims (non-overlapping scopes attempted; conflict resolved by merge)
- arena/d730bd96-koreatrip1 (this session) — full verification, site build, index/subpages, flagged review, GH Pages publish.
- Other session (origin/main) — assets/app.js, data/sources.json, data/trip.json, entries.html, hours.html, itinerary.html, transit.html.

Status after merge: both file sets present; shared HTML (index/flagged/sources) takes verified version from this session; other session's data/assets preserved.
